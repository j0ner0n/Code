## Data Structures and Algorithms

I have taken various assignments based on usage of Data Structures of categories such as _Lists, Maps, Sets, Deques (Stack/Queue)_, learned how to work with Graphs and how to handle files by working with csv files. I have also been introduced in how to write proper tests prior to working on a project.
   
The code from all assignments contains significant amount of proprietary code of the lecturer and is therefore not shared here.
