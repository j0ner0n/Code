# Robotic EV3 Projects

Both the assisted and complete maze-solver programs (written in Java and [leJOS](www.lejos.org)) are used to guide a [Lego Mindstorms EV3](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/mindstorms-ev3) through a maze system.

Both programs were designed and implemented as a group. Our group consisted of Jake Pierrepont, Jonathan Caines and me (all First Years at the time). Permission for publication has been ensured prior to uploading and all files have authors assigned to them that were responsible for the specific code segment.
