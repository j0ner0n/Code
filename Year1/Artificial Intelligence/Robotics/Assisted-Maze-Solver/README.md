# Assisted Maze Solver

The assisted maze solver program was the first (marked) assignment we had using the robot.
The maze was just a grid of **black tape-lines** where the robot should follow the line and every possible occurance of intersection with **green tape as additional information** had a specified action so at the end the robot should have traversed the maze. Additionally if it detects an **object on the path** it should move around it and continue.

We used light and IR sensors to detect the lines (and their color) and objects respectively.

Our specifications were:
