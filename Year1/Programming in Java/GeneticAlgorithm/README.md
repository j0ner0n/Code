## Genetic Algorithms

In my course **Programming in Java** we were assigned to implement a Genetic Algorithm.
The java program must contain a general class _GA Application_ which then is specified for 3 tasks into a _Binary Maximiser_, _Weasel_ and _Maths_.


The Binary Maximiser's goal is to turn all binary 0's into 1's.

The Weasel class is supposed to generate a given String.

Finally, the Maths algorithm is supposed to generate a mathematical equation that equals the given integer.

All 3 Genetic Algorithms begin with random values and are allowed to perform mutation, crossover and a fitness evaluation to reach the goal. A class _Individual_ was used to generate these possible solutions (building the population).
