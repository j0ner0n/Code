# Genetic Algorithms

In my course **Programming in Java** we were assigned to implement a Genetic Algorithm.

All 3 Genetic Algorithms begin with a fixed number of random values of an alphabet. They are allowed to perform mutation, crossover and fitness evaluations (evaluating the quality of the solution) to reach their goal state as a **software implementation of natural evolution**. A class _Individual_ was implemented to generate these possible solutions (the population).

The Java program contains a general class _GA Application_ which then is specified into the 3 subtasks _Binary Maximiser_, _Weasel_ and _Maths_.

- The Binary Maximiser's goal is to turn an array of random binary numbers into an array containing only 1s.
- The Weasel class is supposed to generate a given String from random characters.
- Finally, the Maths algorithm is supposed to generate a mathematical equation that equals the given integer from initially random numbers and operators.
