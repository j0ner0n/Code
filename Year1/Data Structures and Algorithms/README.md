## Data Structures and Algorithms

I have taken various assignments based on usage of Data Structures of categories such as _Lists, Maps, Sets, Deques (Stack/Queue)_, learned how to work with Graphs and how to handle files by working with csv files. I have also been introduced to writing proper tests using JUnit when working on project work.
   
The code from all assignments contains significant amount of proprietary code of the lecturer and is therefore not shared here.
